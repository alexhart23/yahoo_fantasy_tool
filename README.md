# yahoo_fantasy_tool
<b>Tool is designed to have two major functions</b><br>
1) Download relevant fantasy football data from the Yahoo API<br>
2) Manipulate that data into rankings, dynasty information, and more<br>

Yahoo's support for salary style dynasty leagues is largely lackluster, so the tool was designed to compensate for Yahoo's limitations

<b>API pulls currently supportered:</b><br>
1) Download various league specific data (number of teams, starting positions, number of roster spots)<br>
2) Manager information<br>
3) Auction draft results<br>
4) Current rosters<br>
5) YTD points<br>
6) TODO: projected points<br>
7) TODO: Player pool<br>
8) Player info<br>

<b>Data Manipulation (in progress)</b><br>
1) TODO: Calculate future player salary increases (taking into account special rules for players under rookie contract)<br>
2) TODO: Custom rankings taking into account player salary<br>
3) TODO: Projected player cost relative to managers' salary cap<br>
